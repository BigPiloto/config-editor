## Container

Shows which container is being managed according to the file selected in the file tree

Example:
- Container: traccar
- Container: cloudflared

> [!NOTE]
> Without a selected file, or if the selected file has no associated container, the default container will be displayed: `Container: config-editor` (or, if defined, the friendly name in `CONTAINER_ALIAS`)

- ðŸŸ¡ Running Â· Unhealthy â†’ container is running but has health issues
- ðŸ”´ Stopped â†’ container stopped

> [!NOTE]
> If no file is selected, or if the selected file has no associated container, the health status of the container defined in `DEFAULT_CONTAINER` will be displayed
>
> If `DEFAULT_CONTAINER` is also not defined, only `âš«` will be displayed, without reference to any container

![Container Status Error](/documentation/images/container_erro.png)

> [!TIP]
> Clicking on the Status opens a pop-up showing the state of all monitored containers (not just the current one). This allows you to get an overview of the environment directly from the interface

![Container Pop-up](/documentation/images/pop-up_containers_en.png)

Inside the pop-up there are:
- Button to `Restart` the container
- Button to `Close` the pop-up

## User

![User](/documentation/images/user.png)

Clicking it opens a menu with options such as:

- `Editor` â†’ returns to the main editor
- `Change username` â†’ page to modify the username
- `Change password` â†’ page to update the login password
- `Two-factor authentication` â†’ page to enable or disable 2FA (TOTP)
  - This option only appears if the `TOTP_ENABLED` environment variable is set to `true`
