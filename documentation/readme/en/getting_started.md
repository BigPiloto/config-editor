# Getting Started

In the file [README](/README.md) there is an explanation of what Config Editor is, its features, installation methods, and a basic example of how to run the container

In this tutorial, we will go into more detail about the configuration options available during installation

### Image

Defines the application image, recommended to use `bigpiloto/config-editor:latest`

### Container name

Here you define a name for your container (can be any)

Example:
``` yaml
container_name: config-editor
```

### User: "0:0"

This parameter is required to allow interaction with **docker.sock**

With it, Config Editor can inspect containers and execute `Restart` directly from the interface

### Restart

Automatic restart policy defined in Docker

* always → Docker always restarts the container, regardless of the reason it stopped
* on-failure → Docker only restarts the container if it exits with an error (non-zero exit code)
* unless-stopped → Docker does not restart containers that you manually stopped with docker stop

### Ports

By default, the app runs on port 8000 inside the container

You can expose this port on any external port you prefer

Example:
``` yaml
ports:
  - "8001:8000"   # accessible at http://host:8001
```

### PORT

Internal port used by the application, do not change (always 8000)

### DATA_DIR

`DATA_DIR` defines where the application stores all its working files:

- Edited configuration files
- Backups (.backups)
- Temporary files (.tmp)

Default is `/data`

You can change this path, but you must keep consistency with the volumes in `docker-compose.yml`

Example with default:
```yaml
environment:
  DATA_DIR: "/data"
volumes:
  - /srv/config-editor/data:/data
```

### TOTP_ENABLED

Defines whether two-factor authentication (2FA) will be enabled in the system

- `true` → 2FA setup will be required at the first login (via Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)
- `false` → initial registration happens with just username and password

### SESSION_SECRET

Define here a random and secure secret key, used for session encryption

It must be generated by the administrator before starting the container

Example generation:
```bash
python - <<'PY'
import secrets, base64
print(base64.urlsafe_b64encode(secrets.token_bytes(48)).decode())
PY
```

### HTTPS_ONLY

Forces the use of HTTPS in the browser

- `true` → all HTTP requests will be redirected to HTTPS

> [!WARNING]
> The container must be behind a reverse proxy or load balancer that provides a valid TLS certificate (e.g., Nginx, Traefik, Caddy)

- `false` → allows access via both HTTP and HTTPS (recommended only for testing or internal networks)

### TZ

Container timezone, change according to your region

### DIFF_ALLOW_EDIT

Controls whether the diff view mode allows direct editing

- `false` → you can only view differences
- `true` → enables editing directly within the diff screen

### DISABLE_DOCKER_CHECKS

Controls whether Config Editor should interact with Docker to check container status

1. `false` (default) → enables Docker integrations:
   - Shows status/health of associated containers
   - Allows using the **Restart container button**
2. `true` → disables all checks and actions on containers
   - The interface won’t display status nor allow restart
   - Use only in scenarios where it’s **not possible to mount** the `/var/run/docker.sock volume`

### DEFAULT_CONTAINER e CONTAINER_ALIAS

In Config Editor v2, you can define a default container (used when no file association exists) and a friendly alias for it:

```yaml
DEFAULT_CONTAINER: Default container to display in the top bar when no file is selected
CONTAINER_ALIAS: Friendly name for this view (does not need to be the same as default_container)
```

### Volumes
Folder used inside the container for reading and writing configuration files

Example of mounting a complete folder:
```yaml
- /srv/my_services/config:/data
```

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use duplicate names in /data, or there will be conflicts

> [!CAUTION]
> You cannot map different folders to the same /data destination; use subfolders instead
>
> If DATA_DIR was changed, it must also be updated here

Example changing to another directory:
```yaml
volumes:
  - /srv/config-editor/data:/custom_dir
```

Example mounting a subfolder:
```yaml
volumes:
  - /srv/my_services/config:/data/config
```

Example mounting a file:
```yaml
volumes:
  - /srv/my_services/file.extension:/data/file.extension
```
There may be subfolders inside the container

> [!WARNING]
> It is mandatory to always define a host volume for /data even if there are no files

- /data stores:
  1. Edited configuration files
  2. Backups (/data/.backups)

If not mapped, all this information will be lost when the container is removed or restarted

### CONFIG_DIR

Defines the directory where the **application’s internal configuration files** are stored

Default is `/app/config`

It stores:
- `lang.json` → selected language
- `user.json` → initial admin user credentials

> [!WARNING]
> You **must map this volume to the host** if you don’t want to lose language and user/password when recreating the container

Example:
```yaml
- /srv/config-editor/config:/app/config
```

### Docker.sock

The Docker socket volume (`/var/run/docker.sock`) allows Config Editor to connect directly to the host’s Docker Engine

Required for:
- Displaying the status of associated containers
- Allowing the Restart button to work

> [!NOTE]
> If not mounted, Config Editor will only work as a file editor

In this case, also use:
```yaml
DISABLE_DOCKER_CHECKS: "true"
```

### Test

Defines the command Docker executes to check if the container is healthy

If the API does not respond, it returns an error (exit 1) and the container is marked as unhealthy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Required for the healthcheck to work

### Interval

How often Docker runs the healthcheck

You can adjust (30s, 120s, etc.) depending on how much time you tolerate between checks

### Timeout

Maximum time Docker waits for the healthcheck command to finish

You can increase it if your application takes longer to respond

### Retries

Number of consecutive failures tolerated before the container is considered unhealthy

You can reduce (e.g., 3) to detect issues faster, or increase to be more tolerant

### Start Period

Grace period right after the container starts, before healthchecks begin

You can increase it if your application takes longer to start (e.g., 60s)

### Networks

Connects the service to a Docker network

Optional. If you don’t need a dedicated network, you can remove it
